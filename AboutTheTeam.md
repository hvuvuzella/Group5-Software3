Hobbies:

One of my favourite hobbies is Rollerskating (quad wheels!). I started nearly a year ago and I absolutely love it! It's suuuper challenging at first and it feels like a total violation of body mechanics. In fact, you realise pretty quickly that you'll be in a love-hate relationship with the floor. You fall over and hurt yourself all the time when learning new moves. But when it clicks, it CLICKS ðŸ’ª There's so much to learn and so many amazing people to meet in the skating community. I had no idea how big of a community there was in London, heck in the world! Sadly my skating has been put on hold as I pursue a career switch into tech, but I am counting down the days when I will be skating regularly again!

In normal times, you can often find me at the roller rink, in one of my skate classes, or even a skate party when there's one on ðŸ˜„

Here's a little video of me on my wheels (I'm still scared of spins..):

Hobbies:

During the last two years coding has been my hobby. Why hobby?
Because it doesn't bring income ...yet) and it brings fun and
joy ...still) But judging by what my friends say it's not for
long when you start working. So I am enjoying this time now.
Apart from this I like and miss all the winter
sports.

Hobbies:

I used to have lots of hobbies in my life: crocheting, cross stitching, reading... Right now my favorite hobbies are traveling and playing board games with my children and friends. Our favourite game recently is Settlers Catan and Cluedo. And our favourite way to travel was biking to the Scottish islands.

**Iryna Kharchenko**

Hobbies:

My hobby is photography. It is a blend of physical challenges and a touch of psychology.

When I shoot I become more than a photographer, I become a psychologist, intuitively capturing the dynamics and emotions that make each family or couple unique. It's about creating an environment where everyone can be themselves, even during their most vulnerable moments.

Now I paused photography and decided to focus on tech education.

Here is [website](https://zefirphoto.com.ua/) with my works. I hope you enjoy it.

Hobbies:

I really enjoy being active and doing sport. My favourite sports are tennis and badminton, but I will play anything and everything.
I recently started to learn how to play golf which is very challenging but a lot of fun. I also really enjoy cycling, 
snowboarding, swimming, kayaking - really anything water-based!

I have had to put most activities on hold while I am studying for a new job in tech, but I try to fit something in whenever I can!
