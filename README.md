Welcome to our repository.  

The name of our small team of 6 developers is **NatWest Club**  
We love coding almost as much as eating tasty food and highly evaluate the code's quality, so our slogan is ***A code a day, keeps the bugs away!***  

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate 
our GitHub and API building knowledge.
