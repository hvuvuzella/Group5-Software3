# Group5.Software3


Welcome to our repository.

The name of our small team of 6 developers is **NatWest Club**  
We love coding almost as much as eating tasty food and highly evaluate the code's quality, so our slogan is **_A code a day, keeps the bugs away!_**

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate
our GitHub and API building knowledge.

- ## A [requirements.txt file](requirements.txt) file was created:
  - A requirments.txt file in Python outlines all of the dependencies and software packages required by a project, and lists the names and versions of all the relevant libraries and modules.
  - These files are important as they provide a standardized way to track and manage dependencies, and ensures that all collaborators are working in the right virtual environment
  - Using 'pip' tool, developers can quickly install all of the packages they need in the terminal, by using te command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

---

- ## A [.gitignore file](.gitignore) file was created:
  - A gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore.
  - Each line in a gitignore file specifies a pattern. When deciding whether to ignore a path, Git normally checks gitignore patterns from multiple sources, with the following order of precedence, from highest to lowest.

---

- ## For our API, an [Instructions.md file](Instructions.md) was created:
  - Please follow the instrutions in this file before using the API as it contains useful information about setting up and running the files
